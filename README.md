## Objective
- For this challenge, you'll be assuming the role of a BI Consultant for Maven Communications, a California-based Telecommunications company.
- You've been hired to help the company improve retention by identifying high value customers and churn risks, and have been asked to present your findings to the CMO in the form of a single page report or dashboard.

## About this project
- The Project: Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

## Dataset:

- This dataset contains 2 tables, in CSV format:

- Each record represents one customer and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!
- The Zip Code Population table contains complementary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table.

## The Work:

- Connect the raw data and transform it
